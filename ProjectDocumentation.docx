**Project Title**: Business Operations Analysis — SQL Capstone Project  
**Domain**: Business Intelligence, Data Analysis, Database Development  
**Technologies Used**: SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS), T-SQL  



## 1. Project Summary

This project focuses on improving operational efficiency, employee performance, supply chain management, and future strategic planning for a multi-departmental business. It uses SQL-based analysis techniques applied to a comprehensive business operations dataset, leveraging basic and advanced SQL functionalities to extract actionable insights for business decision-making.

The dataset captures employee information, product performance, customer feedback, inventory levels, supplier data, and departmental metrics.



## 2. Objective

- Analyze employee performance trends across departments.
- Identify top-performing products and address customer satisfaction gaps.
- Examine inventory levels to mitigate supply chain risks.
- Assess the impact of employee training programs on operational efficiency.
- Apply advanced SQL concepts for robust database optimization and automation.
- Provide dynamic, reusable database components (Views, Procedures, Triggers, Functions).



## 3. Dataset Overview

**Source**: Business_Operations_Dataset.csv

**Main Fields**:
- **Company Information**: `company_id`
- **Department Details**: `department`
- **Employee Data**: `employee_id`, `employee_name`, `role`, `salary`, `tenure`, `training_completed`, `performance_score`
- **Product Information**: `product_id`, `product_name`, `category`, `customer_feedback_score`, `units_sold`, `revenue`, `profit_margin`
- **Inventory and Supplier**: `inventory_level`, `reorder_point`, `supplier_id`, `supplier_name`

The dataset offers an integrated view of human resources, sales, inventory, supply chain, and customer satisfaction.



## 4. Database Design

### 4.1 Database Creation

- Created a dedicated database `BusinessOperationsDB` in SQL Server.

### 4.2 Table Structure

A single table `BusinessOperations` was created with fields corresponding to the CSV columns. Data types were chosen considering future querying efficiency (e.g., `DECIMAL` for financial figures, `BIT` for boolean flags like `training_completed`).



## 5. Project Execution

### 5.1 Basic Analysis Queries

- **Department with the Highest Average Profit Margin**:  
  Calculated using `AVG(profit_margin)` grouped by department.

- **Top Performer in IT Department**:  
  Retrieved using highest `performance_score` within the IT department.

- **Top Revenue-Generating Product in HR Department**:  
  Identified using `ORDER BY revenue DESC`.

- **Accessories Category Feedback Analysis**:  
  Calculated average `customer_feedback_score` and identified top-rated product.

- **Supplier Inventory Analysis**:  
  Summed up `inventory_level` grouped by `supplier_name`.

- **Inventory Risk in Gadgets Category**:  
  Selected product with minimum inventory.

- **Sales Department Training Impact**:  
  Calculated number and percentage of employees completing training.

- **Marketing Department Sales Contribution**:  
  Total `units_sold` and product-wise contribution analysis.

### 5.2 Advanced SQL Concepts

- **Window Functions**:  
  Used `RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY revenue DESC)` to rank employees.

- **Common Table Expressions (CTE)**:  
  Created CTE to find departments with average salary above $70,000.

- **Views**:  
  Designed a view for easier querying of Accessories products based on revenue and profit margin.

- **Stored Procedures**:  
  Dynamic procedure to get total revenue by passing department name as input.

- **Triggers**:  
  Automated revenue change logging into a separate audit table.

- **Scalar UDF**:  
  A function to calculate profit from revenue and profit margin.

- **Indexes**:
  - Non-clustered index on `employee_name` for fast searching.
  - Clustered index on `company_id` for physical row ordering and performance.

## 7. Key SQL Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Aggregation**: SUM, AVG, COUNT
- **Filtering and Sorting**: WHERE, GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY
- **Joins and Data Relationships** (if extended with future multi-table enhancements)
- **Window Functions**: RANK(), ROW_NUMBER()
- **CTEs**: Common Table Expressions for intermediate result sets
- **Stored Procedures and Parameterization**
- **Triggers for Audit Trails**
- **Views for Simplified Access**
- **Scalar User Defined Functions (UDFs)**
- **Indexing for Query Optimization**



## 8. Challenges Faced

- Ensuring correct data types during table creation to match business metrics accurately.
- Maintaining query performance while using advanced SQL features like window functions.
- Building dynamic solutions (Procedures, Views) to future-proof reporting tasks.
- Managing data import with proper column mapping and handling null values if any.



## 9. Future Enhancements

- Normalize the data into multiple related tables (e.g., Employees, Products, Suppliers) and introduce Foreign Key constraints.
- Add Data Validation or Integrity Constraints during insertions.
- Implement scheduled jobs for automatic revenue monitoring.
- Create real-time dashboards using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) or Power BI connected to this database.



## 10. Conclusion

The project successfully demonstrates how SQL can be utilized not just for simple querying but also for building powerful, dynamic, and efficient systems for business analytics. By applying industry-relevant database practices, this project ensures actionable insights for operational improvement and strategic decision-making.
